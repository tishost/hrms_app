# Android Build Warnings Fix

## Java Version Warnings Solution

### Problem:
```
warning: [options] source value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
warning: [options] target value 8 is obsolete and will be removed in a future release
```

### Solution Applied:

#### 1. Updated Java Version
- Changed from Java 8 to Java 11 in `android/app/build.gradle.kts`
- Added compiler argument to suppress warnings

#### 2. Clean Build Steps:
```bash
cd hrms_app

# Clean Flutter
flutter clean

# Clean Android
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build again
flutter build apk --debug
```

#### 3. Alternative Solutions:

##### Option A: Use Java 17 (Recommended for new projects)
```kotlin
// In android/app/build.gradle.kts
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = JavaVersion.VERSION_17.toString()
}
```

##### Option B: Suppress Warnings (Current Solution)
```kotlin
// In android/app/build.gradle.kts
tasks.withType<JavaCompile> {
    options.compilerArgs.add("-Xlint:-options")
}
```

### Current Configuration:
- ✅ Java Version: 11
- ✅ Warning Suppression: Enabled
- ✅ Compatibility: Maintained

### Notes:
- Warnings are cosmetic and don't affect app functionality
- Java 11 is stable and widely supported
- PDF functionality will work regardless of these warnings
- For production, consider upgrading to Java 17

### Test PDF Functionality:
1. Run app: `flutter run`
2. Go to Invoices
3. Tap any invoice
4. Tap "View PDF"
5. PDF should load without issues
